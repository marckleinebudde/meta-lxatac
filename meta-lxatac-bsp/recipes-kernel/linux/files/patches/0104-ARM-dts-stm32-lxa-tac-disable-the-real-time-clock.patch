Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: stm32: lxa-tac: disable the real time clock
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The RTC was enabled under the false assumption that the SoM already
contains a suitable 32.768 kHz crystal.
It does however not contain such a crystal and since none is fitted
externally to the SoM the RTC can not be used on the hardware.

Reflect that in the devicetree.
