Subject: [PATCH] net: export list of registered ethernet addresses

Network stack keeps an ethaddr_list of Ethernet addresses that were
registered by drivers and board code.

The list currently lacks ethernet devices for which a net_device already
existed. If a net_device is added later on, the list is consulted, but
the element is not removed.

This means ethaddr_list is "the list of registered Ethernet addresses
that were added before the relevant device has been probed". Make it more
useful by genericising it to be "the list of registered Ethernet addresses".

This introduces no functional change (only consumer is fixup code that
handles both cases already), but it allows future board code to consult
the list to check which Ethernet addresses were actually assigned.
